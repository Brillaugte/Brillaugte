# üí´ About Me:
Hi, I'm Max. I've researched self-custodial OTC derivatives for 3 years, and am now developing the first onchain stocks derivatives Kyc-less, and backing stablecoins, decentralized 401k, and flatcoins with them. <br><br>There is no economy without advanced derivatives.<br>If we want crypto adoption, we need :<br>    - BRENT futures settled in Bitcoin. <br>It brings large cash movers to the ecosystem.<br>    -  Make CCP infrastructure that only G20 countries are allowed to do for DeFi. <br>There won't be any market stability and trust without that.<br><br>That's what we do at https://www.pioner.io<br><br>Whitepapers, testnet contract, MT5 hedger are deployed we're making the rest.<br><br>Resume :<br>- 3 years of full time R&D on trustless OTC derivatives<br>- Architect a successful Pioner competitor.<br>- $400k exploiting Binance Futures liquidations.<br>- $1B Volume doing market manipulation on low caps.<br><br>Free time :<br>- Lived in 100+ Airbnbs ( if there is a good sofa on the photos 99% it's a good flat ).<br>- Nerding on QC, FHE, BCI, GPT agents,...<br>- After traveling a lot, found out that having a local community around is the most important.<br>- Arrived during DeFi summer and got addicted to working in crypto.
